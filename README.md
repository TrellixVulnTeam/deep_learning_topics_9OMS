# Introduction to Deep Learning 
# By Chloé Sekkat

This repository has been made as an introduction to deep learning for me, in order to familiarise myself with some basic
topics and frameworks.

This repository has been developed along side the "Introduction to Deep Learning" course I took at TUM. 

## Installation 

You must first install all requirements (preferably inside a virtual environment):
